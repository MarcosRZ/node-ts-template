# node-ts-template

Just bare minimums to start writing Node in TS with a decent tooling base. Basically types, linting and dev pipeline.

Suggestions are welcome! ðŸ™‚

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

Run, compile and watch:

```bash
bun run dev
```

build

```bash
bun run build
```
lint (tslint)

```bash
bun run lint
```
Run production build (requires a previous build)

```bash
bun start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.25. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
